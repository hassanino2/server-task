## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+
- AWS CLI configured with credentials
- AWS CDK installed globally: `npm install -g aws-cdk`

## ‚úÖ **Phase 6 Completion Criteria**

You can call Phase 6 (and the project!) **complete** when:

- [x] **README.md** is updated with overview, setup, features, architecture diagram, and deployment guide  
- [x] Codebase is clean (no unused files, properly commented, formatted)  
- [x] Project is easy to clone and deploy from scratch  
- [x] Repo is ready for GitHub (nice README + diagram)  

At this point, you have a **production-ready, portfolio-worthy project** that demonstrates:

- AWS CDK Infrastructure as Code  
- Serverless architecture  
- Secure pre-signed uploads  
- AWS Rekognition integration  
- A React frontend with Material UI
